            <h3>Can a pandemic finally push the diamond trade into the digital age?</h3>

            <p>Covid-19 has created a glitch in our traditional business practices with strict social distancing
                requirements and restricted global travel. Our only option is to adapt and invent new methods of
                commercial interaction to answer the industry’s emerging needs. Luckily, there is an innovative and
                immediate solution out there.</p>

            <p>Rough diamond trade has always been a business that depends heavily on in-person interactions. In fact,
                for over one hundred years, the industry has not changed and neither has its sales process. The age-old
                process has been this: buyers from around the world travel regularly to look at stones in major diamond
                trading hubs such as Belgium, India, Israel, Hong Kong, UAE, and the USA. Purchases were and are still
                made based on their physical visits to see and touch the diamonds. In many cases, the data has not been
                provided to the buyers for this reason.</p>

            <p>
                While governments begin to ease restrictions on movement for citizens, the reality for many is that
                flights are still restricted or not available for travelers. This forces us to adapt and innovate if we
                desire to create a new normal that allows the diamond industry to continue to thrive no matter what.
            </p>

            <p>
                BidGemmer is facing this challenge head-on and, in response, we’ve rapidly built an advanced, high-end
                solution for diamond traders, such as First Element, who can continue their cross-border activities
                virtually and with confidence.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“In these uncertain times, where international travel is severely restricted, it was imperative for
                    First Element to allow all their buyers from around the world, the opportunity to bid and
                    participate in their upcoming tenders”</p>
                <cite>– Johan Erikson, CEO of First Element in a recent interview with The Diamond Loupe.</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <p>BidGemmer, the most technologically advanced SaaS diamond trading solution, provides a highly-secured and
                transparent platform that allows companies like First Element to offer a solution to its customers, so
                they can make informed purchasing decisions without the need to visit their Antwerp based office.</p>

            <h3>Some key features of the platform include:</h3>

            <ul className="features-list">
                <li><i className='bx bx-badge-check'></i> High-res photography and 3D imagery</li>
                <li><i className='bx bx-badge-check'></i> Diamond scan for detailed analysis and planning</li>
                <li><i className='bx bx-badge-check'></i> Composition breakdown of parcels</li>
                <li><i className='bx bx-badge-check'></i> AI-powered recommendations on past diamond/lot purchase</li>
                <li><i className='bx bx-badge-check'></i> In-app personal face-to-face meetings</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Change is hard for business, but the BidGemmer platform provides an opportunity for buyers, who have
                previously preferred to see stones in hand, a way to see them easily without traveling. Buyers can
                actually see stones with self-assurance and stay competitive. Additionally companies like Russian Miner
                Alrosa have shown that digital tenders can be a great solution for those who are willing to work
                remotely. Moreover, their customers have confirmed that digital scans can provide data that they are
                happy with on every stone.
            </p>

                people are finding creative ways to conduct business. BidGemmer is at the forefront of this change with
                pride. When buyers observe they are able to get a near in-person experience from the comfort and safety
                of their office, they may think again before the next long-haul. Are you ready to embrace the pioneering
                technology that will give your business an advantage in the post-COVID era?</p>
