            <h3>Why it’s time for the diamond trade to think beyond COVID-19 with long-term digital solutions</h3>

            <p>A diamond is forever. That’s the marketing slogan De Beers Group has been using for more than 70 years,
                and it has worked like a charm. Diamonds are in fact timeless, and thanks to modern technology, the
                diamond trade itself can become just as timeless by moving their trade platform online. This will allow
                companies to enjoy more efficiency, increased transparency, reduced costs, and build protection against
                future market disruptions.
            </p>

            <p>Let’s rewind back to the beginning of 2020, when the diamond and gemstone industry relied on physical
                meetings and in-person trade shows. Digitization of the sector was minimal and many traders,
                manufacturers, and mining companies relied heavily on paper records and other antiquated systems. These
                are systems that still leave many sellers exposed to financial or reputational risk today. This is one
                of many reasons why the industry is gradually turning to blockchain solutions, which helps facilitate
                tracking from mine to consumer.
            </p>

            <p>Some innovators have fought hard to adapt by taking advantage of going digital. World-leading supplier of
                responsibly sourced coloured gemstones, Gemfields, is one such example. Recently Gemfields worked with
                BidGemmer to implement a customized platform to strengthen trust among their customers when making
                remote transactions. They used BidGemmer to run online emerald auctions to analyze the status of a
                market hurt by the pandemic:

            <blockquote>
                <p>“We were very pleased with the performance of the new online bidding platform specially adapted for
                    Gemfields by BidGemmer. We thank the BidGemmer team for their unrelenting work in the run-up to what
                    we believe is the world’s first ever instance of rough emeralds being sold via online auction.”

            <h3>How Digitization Empowers Growth and Reduces Risk</h3>
            <p>It’s important to look beyond Covid-19, which has merely accentuated the challenges that already
                existed–a lack of automation of routine sales operations, difficulties maintaining and analyzing
                customer information, and the high costs associated with building software in-house or using a software
                consulting firm.
            </p>
