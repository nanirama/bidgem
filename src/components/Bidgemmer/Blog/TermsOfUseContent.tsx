                            service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their
                            safety online, as moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive
                            service should be made aware of the potential risks to them. Where we do moderate an
                            interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the
                            moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.
